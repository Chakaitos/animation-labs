      'Make it fun and high-energy with bright yellow and blue. The Pokémon logo bounces in from above with a cute squash-and-stretch landing and a gentle bouncy camera zoom. Then zoom attention toward the "O" and have it shimmer and morph into a 3D Pokéball. The Pokéball wiggles, pops open with a burst of confetti and sparkly light, and a cheerful Pikachu jumps out and lands on top. Add playful electric arcs from Pikachu\'s cheeks that light up the logo and toss confetti around like chaos-in-a-good-way. End with the full logo centered, Pikachu posing beside it, confetti settling, and a final upbeat musical riff. Sound should feel like cartoon pops, magical sparkles, whistles, and light zaps.',

      'Keep it cinematic, bold, and dramatic with moody lighting and deep shadows on a light lavender background. Start with the black Nike swoosh centered, and use a soft spotlight that slowly reveals it while heavy shadow beneath it to make it feel powerful. Add a charged atmosphere with a few subtle embers drifting by and a faint smoky haze. Then have the swoosh suddenly blast forward like a comet, leaving a fiery trail of sparks and glowing embers that arcs across the frame, with quick metallic flares to emphasize speed and impact. Follow that motion with a dynamic camera move that swings with the arc, briefly goes wide, then tightens into a tracking shot as the energy builds. End with the swoosh landing back in the center, still glowing with residual heat, a little smoke wisping off the edges, and dramatic light rays fading down as everything settles back into a clean, crisp final logo on lavender. Sound should be a low orchestral rumble with deep percussion, soft wind and ember crackles at the start, rising whooshes and flame roar during the streak, then a strong impact echo and a quiet cinematic resolve to finish.',

      'Make it feel like a vintage surf film. Warm sun-bleached grading, subtle film grain, light leaks, and a soft retro vignette on a clean white background. Start with the hands logo centered, with gentle ocean wave double exposure near the bottom. Slowly pan and lightly zoom like handheld film. Then have the hands morph in a dreamy hand-drawn way into a surfer and wave. The fingers stretch and flow into a silhouette paddling, then standing up on a stylized curling wave. Follow the surfer with a slow dolly and gentle sway, add sunlight sparkle through spray, and keep the film edges fluttering. End by morphing everything back into the original hands logo, matching the first frame so it loops cleanly. Sound should be chill retro jazz with surf guitar, ocean ambience, distant seagulls, and light vinyl crackle.',

Add a subtle aqua glow inside the flask area as the shape completes. Then animate an aqua liquid filling from the bottom up with minimal bubbles rising and popping in sync with a soft electronic beat. Keep shadows and highlights subtle so it feels premium, not cartoony. Finish with the logo snapping into crisp focus and the "ANIMATION LABS" text fading in below in black. Add a gentle aqua glow and a soft shadow, plus a couple of minimal geometric corner accents. Sound should be quiet electronic chimes and light bubbling textures with a smooth final swell.',

      'Make it feel like an epic cinematic logo intro with a medieval, battle forged vibe. Start on a clean light background with the title already visible, but keep it slightly gritty like ink or stamped metal. The sword is centered like a cross, and you see a faint ember glow running down the blade as if it just heated up. Quickly transition into a deep black scene as flames surge across the screen beneath the text, with heavy smoke clouds rolling in and sparks blasting outward. Let the sword become the hero for a moment. Have it rotate and sweep through frame with a fast whoosh, carving a circular ring of fire on the ground while embers scatter and ash drifts. In the smoke, reveal a few glowing fiery symbols in the distance, like runes appearing through heat and flame. Then bring everything back together into the final lockup. The full title settles center, the sword perfectly vertical, and the letters shift from dark steel to warm gold as if they are being heated by the fire licking around the edges. Keep the camera mostly steady with a subtle push in, add a tiny shake on the big flame burst, and finish with the logo crisp on black while the fire fades down to a soft ember glow. Sound should be deep cinematic rumble, big flame whooshes, crackling embers, metal swishes and a light sword clang on the final settle.',

      'Keep it luxury and intimidating, with a strong horsepower vibe like a cinematic hypercar launch. Start on a deep black background with a very subtle brushed-metal or carbon texture, then reveal the Lamborghini shield with a slow, controlled light sweep that emphasizes the gold edges like polished hardware. As it appears, add a restrained "engine presence" effect. A low vibration in the air, tiny dust motes trembling, and a faint heat-haze shimmer behind the logo as if a massive V12 just came to life. Let the bull catch a sharp gold glint on the horns and shoulders, then add a short, powerful pulse that radiates outward like a pressure wave, suggesting torque and traction. Camera should begin as a slow dolly-in, then do a brief forward surge and micro shake on the pulse, returning immediately to smooth stability so it still feels premium. Sound should be expensive and aggressive. A deep cinematic rumble, a clean rising rev, a tight bass hit on the pulse, and a subtle whoosh on the light sweep. End with the logo perfectly centered and razor sharp, light fading into a confident, quiet hold.',
