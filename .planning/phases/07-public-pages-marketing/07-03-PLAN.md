Create app/pricing/page.tsx as a Server Component with:

1. **Metadata export**:
   ```typescript
   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'Pricing - AnimateLabs',
     description: 'Simple, transparent pricing for professional logo animations. Choose from Starter ($30/month) or Professional ($75/month) plans.',
   }
   ```

2. **Page structure**:
   ```typescript
   <div className="min-h-screen">
     <MarketingHeader />
     <main className="container mx-auto px-4 py-16">
       {/* Page content */}
     </main>
     <Footer />
   </div>
   ```

3. **Page header**:
   - h1: "Choose Your Plan" text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-4
   - Subtitle explaining value: "Professional logo animations at a fraction of traditional costs. All plans include access to all animation styles and email support." max-w-2xl mx-auto text-center text-xl text-muted-foreground

4. **Monthly/Annual toggle** (UI space reserved per CONTEXT.md):
   - Container: flex items-center justify-center gap-3 text-sm mb-8
   - "Monthly" label (font-semibold when active)
   - Switch component with disabled prop (functionality deferred)
   - "Annual" label with "(Save $60/year)" in text-xs text-primary
   - Note: Hardcode isAnnual = false, toggle is visual placeholder only

5. **Promo code input** (per CONTEXT.md - UI placeholder):
   - Container: max-w-sm mx-auto mb-8
   - Label: "Have a promo code?" text-sm text-muted-foreground
   - Input with placeholder="Enter code" and disabled prop
   - Note: Backend integration deferred per CONTEXT.md

6. **Pricing cards** (similar to homepage but can be more detailed):
   - Grid: grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-16
   - Same structure as PricingSection.tsx cards (Starter and Professional)
   - Include all features from lib/stripe/config.ts PLANS object
   - Use Check icon from lucide-react for feature list
   - CTAs: "Select Plan" buttons linking to /signup

   - h3: "Technical Failure Guarantee" font-semibold mb-2
   - Paragraph explaining guarantee (per CONTEXT.md): "If technical issues prevent video delivery, we'll refund your credit. This guarantee covers system failures, not subjective quality preferences. Check our extensive example gallery to ensure our animations meet your expectations before subscribing."
   - Link to homepage examples: Link href="/#examples"

8. **FAQ Section**:
   ```typescript
   const FAQS = [
     {
       question: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
       answer: 'Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. Your credits remain valid until the end of your billing period.',
     },
     {
       question: 'What happens to unused credits?',
       answer: 'Subscription credits reset each month. We recommend choosing a plan that matches your monthly needs. You can always purchase additional credit packs if needed.',
     },
     {
       question: 'What is your refund policy?',
       answer: 'We refund credits only for technical failures that prevent video delivery. Quality preferences are subjective—our extensive example gallery shows exactly what you\'ll get before you subscribe.',
     },
     {
       question: 'How long does video delivery take?',
       answer: 'Most videos are delivered within 10-15 minutes. Processing time may vary slightly based on complexity and current demand.',
     },
     {
       question: 'Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?',
       answer: 'Yes, you can change your plan at any time. When upgrading, you\'ll receive additional credits immediately. When downgrading, the change takes effect at your next billing cycle.',
     },
     {
       question: 'Do you offer annual plans?',
       answer: 'Annual billing will be available soon, saving you $60/year on the Professional plan. Currently, we offer monthly subscriptions.',
     },
