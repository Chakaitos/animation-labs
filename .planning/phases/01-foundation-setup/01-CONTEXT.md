# Phase 1: Foundation & Setup - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Project scaffolding and infrastructure — Next.js 14+ app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Supabase setup, database schema, and configuration. This phase delivers the technical foundation that all other phases build upon.

## Implementation Decisions

### Skill Usage Requirements (Project-Wide)

These skills MUST be used at the appropriate times throughout all phases:

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `frontend-design` | When building ANY UI components, pages, or visual elements |
| `llm-application-dev:prompt-engineer` | When generating/optimizing prompts for n8n workflows |
| `backend-development:api-design-principles` | When designing ANY API endpoints or routes |
| `n8n-mcp-skills:*` | When fixing, troubleshooting, or updating n8n workflows |

### Documentation Requirements

- Update `CLAUDE.md` after completing each significant step
- Include: commands used, patterns established, conventions decided
- Keep CLAUDE.md as the living reference for the codebase

### Claude's Discretion

- Project folder structure and organization
- Database schema design (tables, columns, relationships)
- Naming conventions for files, components, and database entities
- Environment variable structure
- shadcn/ui theme and component configuration
- Development environment setup approach

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches for Next.js + Supabase + shadcn/ui stack.

User trusts Claude's judgment on technical implementation details.
