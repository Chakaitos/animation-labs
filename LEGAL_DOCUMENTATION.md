- Each standard video creation costs 1 credit
- Credits are granted at the start of each billing period
- Additional credits may be purchased separately

- Small Pack: 5 credits for $20

```
7.1 General Refund Policy
**Subscriptions are non-refundable.** We do not provide refunds for subscription fees, unused credits, or partial billing periods.

7.2 Technical Failure Guarantee
We will refund credits ONLY in the following circumstances:

- **Complete Delivery Failure:** Video is not delivered due to system error
- **Corrupted Output:** Video file is damaged or unplayable
- **Processing Failure:** System fails to process video after 24 hours

7.3 Non-Refundable Situations
We do NOT refund credits for:
- Subjective quality preferences or dissatisfaction with animation style
- Change of mind after video is delivered
- User error in logo upload or input specifications
- Videos that do not match user's creative vision or expectations
- Delays in processing time (unless exceeding 24 hours)

**Important:** We provide an extensive example gallery showing our animation styles and quality. By subscribing, you acknowledge that you have reviewed these examples and understand the output you will receive.

7.4 Refund Process
To request a credit refund for technical failure:
1. Contact support@animationlabs.com within 7 days of video creation
2. Provide video ID and description of technical issue
3. Allow up to 5 business days for investigation

7.5 Dispute Resolution
If you believe a refund was wrongly denied, you may request review by emailing billing@animationlabs.com within 14 days of the denial.

7.6 Fraudulent Refund Requests
Repeated fraudulent refund requests may result in account termination and legal action.
```

**Purpose:** Protects Animation Labs from subjective quality disputes while providing recourse for genuine technical failures.

**Industry Context:** Similar to policies from Dropbox (no refunds) and Azure (limited refund windows). This approach is increasingly common in SaaS.

**Legal Basis:** Courts generally uphold "no refund" policies when:
- Clearly disclosed before purchase
- Service is delivered as described
- Examples are provided to set expectations

**2026 Compliance:** California AB 2426 and similar laws require clear disclosure of digital goods refund policies before purchase.

## Compliance Recommendations

### Critical Compliance Issues to Address

#### 1. Cookie Consent Banner (GDPR/ePrivacy)

**Issue:** EU law requires opt-in consent for non-essential cookies before they are placed.

**Current Risk:** If Animation Labs places analytics or marketing cookies without consent, it violates GDPR and ePrivacy Directive.

**Solution:**
- Implement a cookie consent banner on first visit
- Pre-block non-essential cookies until consent is given
- Provide granular consent options (accept all, reject all, customize)
- Use a library like [CookieYes](https://www.cookieyes.com/) or [Osano](https://www.osano.com/)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// components/CookieConsent.tsx
// Use a third-party consent management platform (CMP)
// Or implement banner with consent state stored in localStorage
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for EU users)

---

#### 2. Privacy Rights Portal

**Issue:** Manually handling data access, deletion, and portability requests is inefficient and error-prone.

**Current Risk:** Slow responses to DSAR (Data Subject Access Requests) may violate GDPR 30-day deadline and CCPA 45-day deadline.

**Solution:**
- Build a self-service privacy portal in account settings
- Allow users to:
  - Download all their data (JSON export)
  - Delete their account and all data
  - View and correct profile information
  - Opt out of marketing
  - View and manage cookie preferences

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/(protected)/account/privacy/page.tsx
// - Data export button (generates JSON of all user data)
// - Account deletion button (with confirmation)
// - Marketing preferences toggles
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Nice-to-have for compliance, reduces manual support)

---

#### 3. Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with Vendors

**Issue:** GDPR requires written Data Processing Agreements with all service providers that process personal data.

**Current Risk:** Without DPAs, Animation Labs is non-compliant with GDPR Art. 28.

**Solution:**
- Execute DPAs with all service providers:
  - **Supabase:** DPA available at https://supabase.com/dpa
  - **Stripe:** DPA available at https://stripe.com/legal/dpa
  - **Resend:** DPA available (check their legal page)
  - **n8n:** If self-hosted, no DPA needed; if cloud, obtain DPA

**Action Items:**
1. Download DPA templates from each vendor
2. Sign and retain copies in legal records
3. Ensure DPAs include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for international transfers

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for GDPR compliance)

---

#### 4. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for US Transfers

**Issue:** Post-Schrems II, transferring data from EU to US requires SCCs and supplementary measures.

**Current Risk:** Data transfers to Supabase, Stripe, and other US providers may violate GDPR.

**Solution:**
- Ensure all US-based vendors provide EU SCCs
- Implement supplementary measures:
  - End-to-end encryption where possible
  - Minimize data transferred
  - Strong access controls

**Verification:**
- Supabase: Offers SCCs (https://supabase.com/privacy)
- Stripe: Certified under Privacy Shield successor frameworks and offers SCCs

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for EU data transfers)

---

#### 5. User Consent for Video Marketing Use

**Issue:** Section 10.2 of Terms states Animation Labs can use generated videos for marketing, with opt-out option.

**Current Risk:** Using videos without explicit opt-in may violate privacy expectations.

**Solution:**
- Add checkbox during video creation: "Allow Animation Labs to use this video in our example gallery"
- Default: Unchecked (opt-in, not opt-out)
- Provide clear opt-out mechanism in account settings

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/create-video/_components/ReviewStep.tsx
<Checkbox>
  Allow Animation Labs to showcase this video in our public gallery
</Checkbox>
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Good practice, reduces complaints)

---

#### 6. Refund Request Tracking and Dispute Mechanism

**Issue:** Section 7 of Terms limits refunds to technical failures, but lacks formal dispute resolution.

**Current Risk:** Perceived unfairness may lead to chargebacks or complaints to consumer protection agencies.

**Solution:**
- Create a formal refund request system:
  - User submits request through support ticket
  - Request is reviewed by a human (not auto-denied)
  - Clear communication of decision with reasoning
  - Option to escalate to management for review

**Implementation:**
- Add support ticket category: "Refund Request - Technical Failure"
- Track all refund requests in database
- Generate quarterly report of refund patterns

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Reduces disputes and chargebacks)

---

#### 7. Clear Credit Expiration Disclosure

**Issue:** Section 5.2 of Terms states subscription credits expire monthly.

**Current Risk:** FTC and state consumer protection laws require clear disclosure of expiration policies before purchase.

**Solution:**
- Display credit expiration policy prominently on:
  - Pricing page (add callout box)
  - Checkout flow (confirmation before payment)
  - Subscription confirmation email
  - Account dashboard (show expiration date)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/pricing/page.tsx
<Alert>
  <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle>Credit Expiration Policy</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Subscription credits reset monthly and do not roll over.
    Purchase credit packs for non-expiring credits.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

**Priority:** HIGH (FTC compliance, reduces user complaints)

---

#### 8. Terms and Privacy Policy Acceptance at Signup

**Issue:** Users should explicitly agree to Terms and Privacy Policy during account creation.

**Current Risk:** "Browsewrap" (implied acceptance by use) is less enforceable than "clickwrap" (explicit checkbox).

**Solution:**
- Add checkbox at signup: "I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy"
- Checkbox must be unchecked by default
- Make Terms and Privacy Policy links prominent

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx
<Checkbox required>
  I agree to the <Link href="/terms">Terms of Service</Link> and
  <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>
</Checkbox>
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Improves enforceability of Terms)

---

#### 9. Email Unsubscribe Mechanism

**Issue:** CAN-SPAM Act (US) and GDPR require one-click unsubscribe from marketing emails.

**Current Risk:** Non-compliance may result in fines and spam complaints.

**Solution:**
- Add unsubscribe link to all marketing emails
- Process unsubscribes immediately (within 10 business days per CAN-SPAM)
- Honor suppression list permanently

**Implementation:**
- Configure Resend with unsubscribe links
- Create `unsubscribed_users` table in Supabase
- Check suppression list before sending marketing emails

**Priority:** HIGH (Required by law)

---

#### 10. Breach Notification Plan

**Issue:** GDPR requires breach notification within 72 hours; CCPA requires "reasonable" timeframes.

**Current Risk:** Without a plan, Animation Labs may fail to meet notification deadlines.

**Solution:**
- Develop incident response plan:
  1. Detect and contain breach
  2. Assess scope and affected users
  3. Notify users within 72 hours (GDPR) or as required by state law
  4. Notify supervisory authority (GDPR)
  5. Document incident and response

**Implementation:**
- Create `security_incidents` table to track breaches
- Draft email templates for breach notifications
- Designate incident response team

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Preparedness, hopefully not needed)

---

### Recommended Changes to Current Flow

#### Change 1: Add Legal Pages Routes

**Issue:** Terms and Privacy Policy documents must be accessible via public URLs.

**Solution:**
Create public pages for legal documents.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create files
touch app/(marketing)/terms/page.tsx
touch app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx
```

```typescript
// app/(marketing)/terms/page.tsx
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Terms of Service | Animation Labs',
  description: 'Terms and Conditions for Animation Labs logo animation service',
}

export default function TermsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container max-w-4xl py-16 prose prose-slate">
      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      {/* Render terms content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for compliance)

---

#### Change 2: Add Footer Links to Terms and Privacy

**Issue:** Legal pages must be easily discoverable.

**Solution:**
Add links to Terms and Privacy in footer.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// components/marketing/Footer.tsx (update existing)
<footer>
  <nav>
    <Link href="/terms">Terms of Service</Link>
    <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>
    <Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link>
  </nav>
</footer>
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for compliance)

---

#### Change 3: Add Checkbox to Signup Form

**Issue:** Need explicit acceptance of Terms and Privacy Policy.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx (modify existing form)
<div className="flex items-start gap-2">
  <Checkbox
    id="terms"
    required
    checked={acceptedTerms}
    onCheckedChange={setAcceptedTerms}
  />
  <Label htmlFor="terms" className="text-sm">
    I agree to the{' '}
    <Link href="/terms" target="_blank" className="underline">
      Terms of Service
    </Link>{' '}
    and{' '}
    <Link href="/privacy" target="_blank" className="underline">
      Privacy Policy
    </Link>
  </Label>
</div>
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Improves legal enforceability)

---

#### Change 4: Add Credit Expiration Warning to Dashboard

**Issue:** Users may forget credits expire monthly.

**Solution:**
Display expiration date and warning on dashboard.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx (add component)
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Credit Balance</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="text-3xl font-bold">{credits} credits</div>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">
      Expires on {format(subscriptionEndDate, 'MMM d, yyyy')}
    </p>
    {daysUntilExpiration <= 7 && (
      <Alert variant="warning" className="mt-4">
        <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
        <AlertDescription>

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Improves transparency, reduces complaints)

#### Change 5: Add Marketing Opt-In Checkbox

**Issue:** GDPR requires opt-in (not opt-out) for marketing emails.

**Solution:**
Add marketing preference checkbox to signup and account settings.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx (add to form)
<Checkbox
  id="marketing"
  checked={marketingOptIn}
  onCheckedChange={setMarketingOptIn}
>
  Send me product updates and special offers (optional)
</Checkbox>

// Store in profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN marketing_opt_in BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Priority:** HIGH (GDPR compliance)

---

#### Change 6: Implement Cookie Consent Banner

**Issue:** GDPR/ePrivacy requires consent before placing non-essential cookies.

**Solution:**
Use a cookie consent management platform.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// components/CookieConsent.tsx
'use client'

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { Button } from './ui/button'

export function CookieConsent() {
  const [showBanner, setShowBanner] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const consent = localStorage.getItem('cookie-consent')
    if (!consent) {
      setShowBanner(true)
    }
  }, [])

  const acceptAll = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'all')
    setShowBanner(false)
    // Enable analytics
  }

  const rejectAll = () => {
    localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'essential')
    setShowBanner(false)
    // Disable analytics
  }

  if (!showBanner) return null

  return (
    <div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-background border-t p-4 shadow-lg z-50">
      <div className="container flex items-center justify-between gap-4">
        <p className="text-sm">
          We use cookies to improve your experience. See our{' '}
          <Link href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link>.
        </p>
        <div className="flex gap-2">
          <Button variant="outline" onClick={rejectAll}>
            Reject All
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={acceptAll}>Accept All</Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Priority:** HIGH (Required for EU compliance)

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Credit Expiration Policy Must Be Clear:** FTC and state consumer protection laws require prominent disclosure. Add warnings throughout the user journey.

2. **Refund Policy Is Defensible:** Limiting refunds to technical failures is legal if clearly disclosed and justified by subjective quality issues. Ensure example gallery is prominent.

3. **GDPR and CCPA Compliance Is Essential:** Implement cookie consent, DPAs, and privacy rights infrastructure. Failure to comply risks fines up to €20M or 4% of revenue (GDPR).

4. **Clickwrap Acceptance Improves Enforceability:** Add checkbox at signup to ensure Terms are binding.

5. **Prepare for 2026 Multi-State Privacy Landscape:** With 13+ states having privacy laws, unified compliance approach (following GDPR/CCPA as baseline) is most efficient.

6. **AI-Generated Content Ownership Is Evolving:** Joint ownership model (user owns output, platform can use for marketing/improvement) is emerging standard.
